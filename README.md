# Python scripts to plot thermoelectric properties from boltztrap2, phono3py and shengBTE 
  -  Process BoltzTraP2 output file (*.trace)
  -  Perform unit conversions
  -  Adjust the chemical potential by subtracting the Fermi energy level (auto-extracted from VASP OUTCAR)
  -  Generate various plots for analysis (Seebeck, electrical conductivity, electronic thermal conductivity, lattice thermal conductivity, Power Factor and Figure of Merit)
  -  Process Phono3py and ShengBTE output files to extract lattice thermal conductivity & add its contribution to ZT
