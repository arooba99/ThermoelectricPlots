# Thermoelectric Plots
  -  Process BoltzTraP2 output file (*.trace)
  -  Perform unit conversions
  -  Adjust the chemical potential by subtracting the Fermi energy level
  -  Generate various plots for analysis (Seebeck, electrical conductivity, electronic thermal conductivity, Power Factor and Figure of Merit)
  -  Process ShengBTE output files to extract lattice thermal conductivity & add its contribution to ZT
